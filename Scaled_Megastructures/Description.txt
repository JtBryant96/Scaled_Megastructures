This mod is an attempt to (somewhat) accurately scale Dyson Spheres and Ring Worlds based on the stars they're built around, and have them actually be useful.

[b]Dyson Spheres now have the following values:[/b]
[table]
	[tr]
		[th]Star Class[/th]
		[th]Output[/th]
		[th]Build Cost[/th]
		[th]Build Time[/th]

Multiplier is the value the mod multiplies almost all building and pop values by to simulate the planet being larger.

[b]List of other changes:[/b]

Buildings
[list]
[*]New building Planetary Builders Association +10% planet building speed, upgrades to Galactic Builders Association, requires Planetary Builders Association tech
[*]New building Galactic Builders Association +10% empire building and megastructure building speed, +1000 energy and mineral storage, requires 20 pops (to avoid it being too spammable), unlocked with megastructures tech
[*]Renamed Gene Clinic to Planetary Immigration Office
[*]Renamed Cyto-Revitalization Center to Planetary Emigration Office +20% planet growth rate changed to +10% empire growth rate, requires 20 pops
[*]Unit Assembly Plant +20% planet robot build speed changed to +10% empire robot build speed, requires 20 pops
[*]Renamed Mines built on ringworlds to Interstellar Mining Depot
[/list]
Ascension perks
[list]
[*]Removed tier requirements for Master Builders, Galactic Wonders, and The Circle of Life (to allow you to build the smaller structures earlier in the game)
[*]Removed tech requirements for Master Builders
[*]Master Builders +20% megastructure building speed changed to -10% megastructure building cost
[*]Removed Voidborne (and habitats)
[/list]
Game Mechanics
[list]
[*]Disabled resettlement and migration for balance (policy and species right were left in to please/anger factions)
[/list]

[b]Known issues:[/b]
[list]
[*]Robots are not balanced for higher tier ringworlds, most of modifires I used for organic pops don't have robot equivalants.
[/list]

[b]Plans:[/b]
[list]
[*]Do something with the science nexus since I can't figure out a good way to have it scale.
[*]Have the higher tier ringworlds increase naval & starbase cap, and tradition and tech costs more.
[*]Something to use the insane amount of resources the class B structures create.
[*]Compatibility patches for major mods.
[/list]
Do to the large number of changes in this mod I'm clasifing it as a beta, so I can get some balance feedback and bug reports.
